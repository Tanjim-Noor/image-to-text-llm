# Sources of sound aqeedah:

We have seen above the definition and importance of sound aqeedah. Here we will learn
about something that is of the utmost importance, which is: from where do we learn this
aqeedah? This is what is called "the sources from which aqeedah is learned." What are
these sources? And what is the evidence for them?

Before we speak about the sources and the evidence for them, we will point out a definitive
Islamic fact, which is that sound aqeedah (belief in the oneness of Allah) is a common-
sense belief that is in accordance with innate human nature, meaning the principle that
all humans instinctively believe in this aqeedah, and that since Allah created humans and
brought them into existence on this earth, they have held this belief in their hearts. What
that means is knowing Allah عزوجل believing in His oneness, turning to Him at times of
hardship, and loving Him; it means that man has an innate inclination to accept and
choose the truth. This is supported by a great deal of evidence, including the following:

1 The verse in which Allah عزوجل says: {So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to
truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should
there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know}
[ar-Rum 30:30].

Haneefiyyah (referred to in the translation above as "inclining to truth") is Islam and its
pillars, as was explained by the leading scholars of the early generations رحمه الله
The fitrah is sound human nature which is created in people and which has the ability
to accept the true religion.

The report narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah رَضِ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ according to
which the Prophet صَلَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ said: «Every newborn is born in a state of fitrah, then his parents
make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian, just as animals bring forth animals; do
you see any deformed one among them?».
According to another version: «There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah, then
his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian, just as animals bring forth
animals with their limbs intact; do you see any deformed one among them?».
The word translated here as intact refers to one that is complete and has all its limbs. The
word translated here as deformed refers to one that is missing limbs.
Then Abu Hurayrah رَضِ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ recited the words: {[Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which
He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct
religion} [ar-Rum 30:30]. Agreed upon.
3
The report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah رَضِ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ in two different versions, in
which it clearly states that the fitrah is the religion of Islam. They are:
a. <<There is no newborn who is born except he is a believer in this Religion».
b. «There is no newborn who is born except he is a believer in this Religion,
until he begins to speak».
4
It was narrated from Iyad ibn Himar al-Mujashi'i رضي الله عنه that the Messenger of Allah
صَلِّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ said in his khutbah one day: <<[Allah said:] 'And I have created My slaves with
an inclination towards the truth (hunafa), all of them, but the devils come to them and
drive them away from their religion, forbidding them that which I have permitted to
them and instructing them to associate with Me that for which I have not sent down
any authority'». Narrated by Muslim.
The word hunafa (sing. hanif), translated here as "with an inclination towards the truth",
refers to one who inclines away from all other religions and inclines towards the sound
religion of Islam.

# Sources of sound aqeedah
## The first source
1
### The Noble Quran
The Noble Quran is a name for the miraculous words of Allah that were revealed to His
slave and Messenger Muhammad صَلَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ of whom Allah عَوْجَل says: {The Trustworthy
Spirit has brought it down Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners
In a clear Arabic language} [ash-Shu'ara 26:193-195].

### Evidence:
A great deal of evidence indicates that the Quran constitutes proof
from which we must take our aqeedah. That evidence includes the
following:

The Quran instructs us to follow its commands and forbids us to follow
anything else, as Allah عَوْجَل says: {Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed
to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you
remember} [al-A'raf 7:3].

2
Everything in it is sound and true, as Allah عَوْجَل says: {That is [deserved by them]
because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book
are in extreme dissension} [al-Baqarah 2:176]; {Say, "Allah has told the truth"} [Aal Imran 3:95]; {And
who is more truthful than Allah in statement} [an-Nisa 4:87]; {and who is more truthful than
Allah in statement} [an-Nisa 4:122].

It is protected from tampering and distortion, as Allah says: {Indeed, it
is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian} [al-Hijr 15:9].

# Evidence - continued:

It is the judge in which there is an explanation and clarification, as Allah
عزوجل says: {Say}, "Then is it other than Allah I should seek as judge while it is
He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?" And those to whom We
[previously] gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in truth,
so never be among the doubters} [al-An'am 6:114].

5
It is the criterion that distinguishes between truth and falsehood, as Allah
عزوجل says: {Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant that he
may be to the worlds a warner} [al-Furqan 25:1].

The Criterion (al-Furqan) is the Quran, because by means of it Allah عزوجل
differentiated (farraqa) between truth and falsehood.

Allah has instructed us to refer to it in the event of dispute or conflict, as He
عزوجل says: {And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger,
if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in
result} [an-Nisa 4:59] and {And in anything over which you disagree - its ruling is [to
be referred to Allah} [ash-Shura 42:10].

7

6
It is the definitive word which draws the line between what is in earnest and
what is in jest, and it is the farthest removed from falsehood and tampering,
as Allah عزوجل says: {Indeed, the Qur'an is a decisive statement And it is not
amusement} [at-Tariq 86:13-14].
